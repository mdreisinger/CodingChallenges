# CodingChallenges

Please rate yourself on a scale of 1-10 (1 being beginner, 10 being expert) along with your total years of
experience working in the following technical categories
- Python:
    - 7/10
    - 5 years experience.
- Django:
    - 1/10
    - <1 years of experience.
        - However, I do have experience creating FastAPIs's from scratch and maintaining existing APIs written in both Django and Flask.
- JavaScript:
    - 2/10
    - <1 years of experience.
      - However, I have worked with enough JavaScipt to be able to read it and understand what the code is doing. I just don't have enough experience writing JavaScript code from scratch to rate myself higher.
- React:
    - 1/10
    - <1 years of experience.
        - I have never created a front end from scratch, however, I have worked on existing applications that use react. For example, creating tests using Selenium to test a front end. 

NOTE:
- Despite my inexperience in Django, JavaScript, and React, it's worth noting that I am a fast learner and I'm confidident in my ability to pick up the skills on the job and do the work in my own time to learn what I need to learn so that I can be an effective team member as soon as possible.
- Since I graduated with a bachelors degree in mechanical engineer and then went into software engineering straight out of university, everything I have learned over the past 5 years has been on the job, at home doing personal projects, and just working working with extremely knowledgable colleagues and a variety of code bases.
- I know what it takes to onboard quickly on a team where I am not familiar with the tools/technologies. For example:
    - I come in with no ego. I'm not afraid to ask questions that could be considered "dumb".
    - As long as I have a proper work-life balance, I do what I need to in my own time to pickup the new skills faster.
    - Having a mentor at work or someone that I can go to as a first resort for asking questions helps me a lot while onboarding.
    - I understand that a team works together and that we are all working towards the same goal; we are there for eachother.
    - I'm very engaged during meeting such as sprint planning, backlog refinement, retrospectives, and design/brainstorming sessions. Not in a way to show off my knowledge, but to ask the questions that other people are also probably thinking. The worst thing in meetings is a distracted audience/team that's not actively contributing to the goal of the meeting, and the best thing is a whole team that's actively engaged.

# Pre-Interview Questions:
Instead of providing an explanation for each question, I have created a quick video going over my solutions and demonstrating it working: https://youtu.be/2ep2VCzjgtE

## Question 1
An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another. 
For example: Silent is an Anagram of Listen. 
Write an example program that determines if a pair of words are Anagrams.

## Question 2
2. Write a Python function that takes in a list of integers (0 through 10) and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

## Question 4 (I chose question 4 over question 3 since I immediately saw a good solution.)
4. To identify duplicate images, one method is to calculate a hash value for each image and compare them to one another. If two files have the same hash value, they are duplicates.
Given the path to a hypothetical folder on a hard drive which contains a very large dataset of images, calculate the sha256 has for each, and create a dictionary with a key of the hash string and a value which is a list of file paths for images with that hash.
Keep in mind that processing imagers is a CPU intensive activity and develop a solution that minimizes runtime.
